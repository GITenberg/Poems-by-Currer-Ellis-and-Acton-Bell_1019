description: "Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell was a volume of poetry published\
  \ jointly by the three Brontë sisters, Charlotte, Emily and Anne in 1846 (see 1846\
  \ in poetry), and their first work to ever go in print. To evade contemporary prejudice\
  \ against female writers, the Brontë sisters adopted masculine first names. All\
  \ three retained the first letter of their first names: Charlotte became Currer\
  \ Bell, Anne became Acton Bell, and Emily became Ellis Bell. The book was printed\
  \ by Aylott and Jones, from London. The first edition failed to attract interest,\
  \ with only two copies being sold. However, the sisters decided to continue writing\
  \ for publication and began work on their first novels, which became commercial\
  \ successes. Following the success of Charlotte's Jane Eyre in 1848, and after the\
  \ deaths of Emily and Anne, the second edition of this book (printed in 1850 by\
  \ Smith & Elder) fared much better, with Charlotte's additions of previously unpublished\
  \ poetry by her two late sisters. It is believed that there are fewer than ten copies\
  \ in existence with the Aylott and Jones' title-page.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
